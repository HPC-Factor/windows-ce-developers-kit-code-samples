These samples are from the CD which was included with the 4-volume Windows CE Developers Kit book set by Microsoft Press.

# About the Code Samples

Most code samples included on this CD were developed with Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 and the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ version 5.0. The **Sspi** and **Crypto** samples were developed with Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 and the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0. The code in sample applications is ported for a Handheld PC, but the programming concepts that are presented apply to all Windows CE-based platforms.

## Communications sample description

* **Tty:** Shows how to open, configure, and close a serial communications port and perform read/write operations for a TTY terminal emulation application.
* **CeDialer:** Shows how to initialize an application's use of TAPI, open a line device, negotiate an API version to use, translate an address into another format, place a call on an opened line device, close an opened line device, and shut down an applicationï¿½s use of the line abstraction of the TAPI.
* **RasConn:** Demonstrates how to start a RAS connection, dial entries from the default phone book, and close an active connection.
* **Winsock:** A Windows Sockets **Server** and a Windows Sockets **Client** sample. The **Server** sample shows how to implement a Windows Sockets TCP stream socket server. The **Client** sample shows how to implement a Windows Sockets TCP stream socket client.
* **IRSock:** An Infrared Sockets **Server** and an Infrared Sockets **Client** sample. The **Server** sample shows how to implement an Infrared Sockets server. The **Client** sample shows how to implement an Infrared Sockets client.
* **Multicast:** A multicast receiver and a multicast sender sample. The **Receive** sample shows how to receive an IP multicast datagram. The **Send** sample shows how to send an IP multicast datagram.
* **CeHttp:** Demonstrates how to create and submit a HTTP request. The sample requests a default HTML document from a server and displays it along with the HTTP transaction headers.
* **Sspi:** Shows how to use the Security Support Provider Interface to access common authentication and cryptographic data schemes.
* **Crypto:** A cryptography encryption and a decryption sample. The **Encrypt** sample shows how to encrypt data read from a text file. The **Decrypt** sample shows how to decrypt the file created by the **Encrypt** sample.

## GWES sample description

* **CePad:** Shows how to register a window class, and how to create such elements as a window, a menu, dialog boxes, and an edit control. It also shows how to open and save a file, and how to search for and replace a text string in an edit control.
* **CeGDI:** Shows how to create and use graphical device interface (GDI) objects such as pens, brushes, palettes, bitmaps, and regions. It also shows how to enumerate fonts, select a font type, and display some text by using the selected font.
* **Cmdband:** Shows how to register toolbar and rebar control classes, and create a command band with two toolbars in it.
* **Cmdbar:** Shows some common buttons on the command bar and how to create, add bitmaps to, and destroy the command bar.
* **FileView:** Demonstrates how to register tree view and header control classes, and create a tree view control.
* **ListView:** Demonstrates how to register list view and header control classes, and create a list view control.
* **Rebar:** Shows how to register the rebar and toolbar control classes, create a rebar with a toolbar and a combo box in it, and move the rebar up or down.
* **Toolbar:** Shows how to register the toolbar control class, create the toolbar, and add the toolbar ToolTips.
