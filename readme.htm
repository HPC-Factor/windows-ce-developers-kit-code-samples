<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>Most code samples included on this CD were developed with
Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 and the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for
Visual C++ version 5.0. The <B>Sspi</B> and <B>Crypto</B> samples were
developed with Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 and the Microsoft Windows
CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0. The code in sample applications is ported
for a Handheld PC, but the programming concepts that are presented apply
to all Windows CE-based platforms.
